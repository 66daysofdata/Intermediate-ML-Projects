# Intermediate ML Projects

1. **Music Genre Classification**

   **Project Idea**:
   The idea behind this python machine learning project is to develop a machine learning project and automatically classify different musical genres from audio.  We need to classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.

2. **Bitcoin Price Predictor**

**Project idea**: The bitcoin price predictor is a useful project. The blockchain technology is increasing and there are many digital currencies rising. 
This project will help you predict the price of the bitcoin using previous data.

3. **Uber Data Analysis**

**Project idea**: The project can be used to perform data visualization on the uber data. The dataset contains 4.5 millions of uber pickups in the new york city. 
This much data needs to be represented beautifully in order to analyze the rides so that further improvements in the business can be made.

4. **Personality Prediction**

**Project idea**: The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a personality type system that divides a person into 16 distinct personalities based on introversion, intuition, 
thinking and perceiving capabilities. We can identify the personality of a person from the type of posts they put on social media.<br>
